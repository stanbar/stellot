Since he (the government) manages the authorization, he can block a certain users from casting vote.\n          But he can not perform votes on other user behalf since there is only the limited publicly known number of created tokens (e.g. the number of galactictalk active users).\n          Yes, he can assume that only 20% of users will take part in the election, and use the 80% of unspent tokens to perform vote on his behalf.\n          But it still could be mitigated by limiting the number of tokens to the number of users who are incentivized to cast a vote, so the frequency would be high, therefore limiting the number of unspent tokens.\n\n          Decentralized auth is a completely different topic, but It is something I would love to continue my research on.
